# Lane Lines Segmentation

The goal of this project is to use deep-learning based approach (i.e. [FCN](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf)) to segment out lane lines. Compared to traditional methods, FCN is more robust to illumination changes. Data for this task are drawn from [here](https://github.com/mvirgo/MLND-Capstone).
